# Your Future Customers Application Summary
This is an application made by Team Tolmachoff for
the Plano Academy High School 4th years' SouthWest
Airlines [SWA] project, where we emulated the 
business development department. The timeframe was 
September-October 2016. The language used was Java.

#Purpose
We were tasked with creating a program that could log
the amount of time we worked on our SWA project. It was
also to be capable of creating billing statements and 
reports for project purposes, to share at the final 
presentation.
